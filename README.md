# UberEats Case Study
This is a small case study of a online food delivery service (Ubereats) where it contains data of customers with orders, food ,restaurants etc. in 7 different tables.
### The data is just for reference (not the actual data of UberEats)

This small project is a good way to practice SQL queries.

I generated this data to perform my SQL skills on it.

It contains all the SQL queries from Basic to Advanced i.e. it includes aggregate functions, subqueries, windows functions

#### The small project will analyze monthly sale of a food outlet to most loyal customers and many more queries that will provide insights about the Customers and restauratns.
